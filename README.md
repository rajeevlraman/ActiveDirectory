### Key Features:

- **Directory Service:** Stores information about objects on a network (e.g., users, computers, printers) and makes this information available to users and network administrators.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Manages user authentication and authorizes access to network resources based on security policies.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple resources within the network.
- **Group Policy Management:** Centralized management of user and computer settings across the network.
- **DNS Integration:** Uses Domain Name System (DNS) to locate network resources and services.
- **Security:** Provides security features such as encryption, secure authentication protocols (e.g., Kerberos), and access control.

### Components:

- **Domain Controllers:** Servers that manage AD database and authenticate users and computers.
- **Domains:** Logical groupings of objects within AD, identified by a DNS name.
- **Organizational Units (OUs):** Containers used to organize and manage objects within domains.
- **Trust Relationships:** Establishes relationships between domains to share resources and enable access across different domains.

### Use Cases:

- **Enterprise Environments:** Provides centralized management of users, devices, and policies across large organizations.
- **Authentication and Access Control:** Ensures secure access to resources based on organizational policies.
- **Integration with Microsoft Ecosystem:** Seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft products and services.

## Hierarchy of Domain Controllers in Active Directory

### Active Directory (AD) uses a hierarchical model for distributing directory services and managing domain resources.

### Components of the Hierarchy:

1. **Forest:**
   - A forest is the top-level container in Active Directory, consisting of one or more domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog. Each forest has a unique Domain Name System (DNS) namespace.

2. **Domains:**
   - Domains are containers within a forest that define administrative and security boundaries. Each domain stores information about its objects (users, groups, computers) and has a unique Domain Security Identifier (SID).

3. **Domain Controllers (DCs):**
   - Domain Controllers are servers that host AD and respond to authentication and directory service requests within their domain. DCs store a writable copy of the directory database (NTDS.dit) and replicate changes to other DCs in the domain.

4. **Site:**
   - Sites are physical or logical groupings of subnets within an Active Directory forest. Sites help optimize replication traffic and facilitate efficient access to AD resources based on network topology.

### Role and Responsibilities:

- **Authentication:** DCs authenticate users and computers accessing resources within their domain.
- **Directory Services:** DCs store and manage directory data, including user accounts, group policies, and security settings.
- **Replication:** DCs replicate directory changes within their domain and across domains in the forest, ensuring data consistency.
- **Operations Master Roles:** Some DCs hold operations master roles (FSMO roles) responsible for specific domain operations, such as schema updates or RID allocation.

### Deployment Considerations:

- **Redundancy:** Deploy multiple DCs per domain for fault tolerance and high availability.
- **Topology Planning:** Design sites and subnets to optimize AD replication and access.
- **Security:** Implement secure practices for managing DCs, including physical security, patch management, and monitoring.

## Let's see how to Create a Active Directory Service on a Windows Server 2022<br><br>
### I'll be using a Windows Server 2022 Virtual machine created in Virtual Box.

- Steps to follow:
  
  - First Install a virtualization Platform, in this case i'm choosing Virtual Box
  - Download a Windows Server 2022 Evaluation copy from Microsoft Download Centre [ windows Server 2022 ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022)
  - Configure VM with system requirements.
  - Set up two NICs:

  - One with NAT for external access.
 
<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture8.png" /><br>

  - Another with Host-only adapter for host-only access.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture9.png" /><br>

- I have a Pfsense installed and will be using it as a Firewall and a DNS server.  
- The VM traffic is routed through a pfSense firewall.
- Start the VM and follow standard Windows installation instructions.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture10.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture11.png" /><br>

- Choose "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter Evaluation (Desktop Experience)" for lab.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture12.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture13.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture14.png" /><br>

- Complete installation, set password for built-in admin when prompted.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture15.png" /><br>

- Press ` CTRL + ALT + DEL ` to login to the server.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture16.png" /><br>

- Login using username `Administrator` and the provided password.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture17.png" /><br>

- Server Manager starts automatically on startup.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture20.png" /><br>

- In Server Manager the default services are visible.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture21.png" /><br>

- Rename the PC to a sensible name (e.g., `DASHERSLAB AD`).

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture22.png" /><br>

- Restart the PC after renaming.
- Begin installing Active Directory services:

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture23.png" /><br>

  - Click on "Roles and Features".
  - Select installation type as "Roles and Features".

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture23.png" /><br>

  - Select the server displayed (if only one).

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture73.png" /><br>

  - Choose "Active Directory Domain Services" as the server role.
  - Click "Add Features" and then "Next".

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture26.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture27.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture28.png" /><br>

  - Check "Restart if required" on the confirmation screen.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture29.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture30.png" /><br>

  - Click "Install" to install the role.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture31.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture32.png" /><br>

- After installation, a notification prompts for post-deployment configuration to promote this server to a Domain Controller.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture34.png" /><br>

- Start the deployment configuration wizard:
  - Choose "Add a new Forest".
  - Provide a domain name.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture36.png" /><br>

  - Configure optional restore password.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture37.png" /><br>

  - Leave DNS options at default. It will be installed.
 
<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture38.png" /><br>

  - NetBIOS domain name is auto-populated from forest name.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture39.png" /><br>
<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture40.png" /><br>

  - Directory paths can be left as default.
    
<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture41.png" /><br>
<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture42.png" /><br>

  - Review changes; opt for manual installation (not PowerShell script).

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture44.png" /><br>

  - Click "Next" and proceed with prerequisite checks (ignore if needed).
  
<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture45.png" /><br>

  - Click "Install" to begin installation.
- Restart the PC once installation is complete.
- The login screen now displays domain name followed by Administrator as `DASHERSWINLAB\Administrator`.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture46.png" /><br>

- Enter the Domain Administrator password and not the local Administrator password
- This will then Log you in to the newly created domain, not the local PC.
- If you want to log int to the local Pc then you can choose the other user.
- For now lets log in to the Domain.
- Server Manager shows AD DS server group running.

- you can see the Server manager displays the newly added ` AD DS ` and ` DNS services `.

<img align="center" src="assets/images/Picture47.png" /><br>

- Now that we have the Active Directory setup, the DNS `DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM ` service is automatically configured.
- AD DS relies heavily on DNS for name resolution within the domain.
- DNS facilitates locating other domain controllers, domain-joined computers, and other domain resources.
- Of course it can be tweaked according to requirements, but the integration of these services ensures the seamless functioning.
-Now its a good practice to create a  `local Admin ` other than the built in Administrator.
- You can view the process in detail this link [Create An Organizational Unit](https://github.com/rajeevlraman/ActiveDirectory/blob/main/AD_CA.md#OU)
- You can create this [`Admin user`](https://github.com/rajeevlraman/ActiveDirectory/blob/main/AD_CA.md#OU_user) and put the user in an ` Organizational unit `.
- You acan also view the creation of CA Certification Authority here [Create An CA - Certification Authority](https://github.com/rajeevlraman/ActiveDirectory/blob/main/AD_CA.md)
- After creating the user you can login with the new Administrator credentials.
