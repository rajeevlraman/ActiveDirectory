## We need to Add Certificate Authority (CA) Roles in Active Directory.<br>
The CA roles are needed to satisfy and perform various functions in the domain.<br>
The following are when we need the CA roles:
<table>  
 <td>

 ***Issuing Certificates:***
   - CA roles are needed to issue digital certificates for users, computers, devices, and services within your domain or organization.
 
 </td> 
 </table>

 <table>  
 <td>
    
***PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Deployment:***
   - Deploying a PKI infrastructure requires CA roles to manage certificates centrally, including issuance, management, and revocation.
 
 </td> 
 </table>

<table>  
 <td>
    
***Secure Authentication:***
   - Enable secure authentication mechanisms like smart card logon, VPN authentication, and wireless network authentication, which rely on certificates.
 
 </td> 
 </table>

<table>  
 <td>
    
 ***Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:***
   - Ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that mandate certificate use for encryption and data protection.
 
 </td> 
 </table>

 <table>  
 <td>
    
 ***Internal Application Requirements:***
   - Some applications or services require certificates for secure communication or encryption, facilitated by CA roles.
 
 </td> 
 </table>

<table>  
 <td> 
    
***Trust and Authorization:***
   - Establish trust relationships within your organization and with external entities using certificates issued by a trusted CA.
 
 </td> 
 </table>

### Summary

Adding Certificate Authority (CA) roles in Active Directory is crucial for establishing a secure, centralized infrastructure to issue and manage digital certificates. This supports secure communications, authentication mechanisms, regulatory compliance, application requirements, and trust relationships.

## Now lets see how we can add the CA services.

- On the service manager dashboard click on Roles and Features.
- select the roles and feature option.
- since I have only one domain it will be displayed so select it.
- In the Server Roles select &#x2611; Active Directory Certificate Services

# 2. Creating an Organizational Unit (OU):<br>

1. **Open Active Directory Users and Computers**:
   - Go to **Start Menu** → **Administrative Tools** → **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2. **Navigate to the Domain**:
   - Expand the domain node where you want to create the OU (e.g., `AD.DASHERSWINLAB.local`).

3. **Create the OU**:
   - Right-click on the domain or an existing OU where you want to create the new OU.
   - Select **New** → **Organizational Unit**.
   - Name the new OU following a clear naming convention. For example, if creating an OU for Admin Users, you might name it `AdminUsers`. i have named it `LabAdmins`.

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture3.png" /><br>

4. **Set Permissions (Optional)**:
   - Right-click on the new OU (`LabAdmins`) → **Properties**.
   - Go to the **Security** tab to set permissions for who can manage objects within this OU.
   - I'll leave it empty.

### Creating an Admin User in the OU:

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture5.png" /><br>

1. **Create the User Account**:
   - Right-click on the newly created OU (`LabAdmins`) or any other suitable OU.
   - Select **New** → **User**.

2. **Fill Out User Details**:
   - Enter the user's details, including:
     - First name, last name, and username (e.g., `admin_user`).
     - Password (choose a secure password).
     - Ensure the **User must change password at next logon** is unchecked if setting initial password.

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture7.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture8.png" /><br>

3. **Assign User to Groups** (Optional):
   - On the **Member Of** tab, add the user to appropriate groups like `Domain Admins`, `Administrators`, or other relevant groups based on administrative roles.

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture9.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture10.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture11.png" /><br>

4. **Configure User Properties**:
   - Customize settings in other tabs as needed, such as **Account**, **Profile**, **Telephones**, etc.

5. **Finish**:
   - Click **OK** to create the user.

### Naming Conventions:

- **OU Naming Convention**: Choose a clear and descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the OU, such as `AdminUsers` for administrative users or `SalesUsers` for sales department users.
- **User Naming Convention**: Typically, usernames should follow a standard format for consistency and clarity. For example, `firstname.lastname` or `firstinitial.lastname` (`bruce.banner` or `bbanner`). I'll stick with my convention 'FirstnameLastname' (example the user: `Bruce Banner` email has `brucebanner@`.

### Example:

- **OU Name**: `LabAdmin`
- **First name: `Bruce`
- Last name: `Banner`
- **User Name**: `brucebanner`


- Restart the PC and on the login page you should have Other User option. select it.

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture13.png" /><br>

- Enter the New Administrator credentials and sign in to the Domain.
- Use the format Domainname\username ` AD\brucebanner`
- Since we had checked the box saying password must be changed on first login, it should prompt us for change.

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture14.png" /><br>

- Click om OK and enter the current password followed by the new password.
- It will confirm the password chang. Click ok and it should log you in.

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture15.png" /><br>

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture16.png" /><br>

- confirm the login account

<img align="center" src="assets/images_OU/Picture17.png" /><br>

It is always a better practice to use a normal user or Admin other than the built in Admins.
